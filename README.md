## My process

- I'm focusing on practicing 3D animation, particularly the creation of card rotation animations with a 3D perspective in this challenge.

- Additionally, I've implemented error handling using JavaScript:

- Now, if you attempt to submit without selecting a rating, an error message will be displayed.

- Also, if you inspect and modify the rating value to be less than 0 or greater than 5, an error message will appear.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- I learned about 3d perspective animation.
- DOM manipulation with Js
- Error Handling with Js
